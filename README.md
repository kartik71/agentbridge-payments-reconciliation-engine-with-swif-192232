## 🔧 Workflow Steps


### 1. Customer Intake
Collect, validate and normalize positions from SWIFT Gateway; attach a runId and timestamp for traceability.

### 2. Retrieve
Execute retrieve phase for the RAG pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 3. Ground
Execute ground phase for the RAG pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 4. Sanctions Screening
Sanctions Screening across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 5. Limit Control
Limit Control across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 6. Underwriting
Underwriting across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 7. Risk Scoring
Risk Scoring across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 8. Reconciliation Summary
Assemble final payload with status, artifacts, KPIs and audit trail; store to Case Management; return response JSON for the client.
